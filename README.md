# OSU Room Rate App Source Code

This app was created for the 2025-2026 Winter Term Term-Long GDGC Hackathon. It is basically an app that lets users see classrooms/labs/lecture halls they may have used at OSU and rank their overall experience with them.

The app is accessible on web at https://osurooms.bobjoerules.com and soon will be available on the app and google play stores.

# Notes

- This app uses firebase for the ranking system, submissions, and user accounts.
- Atm all of the rooms' info and photo links are hosted in the app but will hopefully one day be moved to firebase (photos have been moved there)
- Comment section for rooms could be added but not that likely
