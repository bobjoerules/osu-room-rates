# OSU Room Rate App Source Code

This app was created for the 2025-2026 Winter Term Term-Long GDGC Hackathon. It is basically an app that lets users see classrooms/labs/lecture halls they may have used at OSU and rank their overall experience with them.

# Notes

- This app uses firebase for the ranking system, submissions, and user accounts.
- Atm all of the rooms' info and photos are hosted in the app but will hopefully one day be moved to firebase
- App is available on the web but some functionality/UI is broken atm
- Comment section for rooms could be added but not that likely
